## 1. Load forecast and EV penetration

Load forecast is very important for power system planning and operation. First visit NYISO website's [Custom Reports](https://www.nyiso.com/custom-reports) to explore all sorts of data out there. We will be focusing on day-ahead market (DAM) forcast (1-hour interval), and actual load (5-min interval and 1-hour interval), and comparing them and analyze how to make forecast better. Download one whole year (2021) of [Real Time Weighted Integrated Actual Load](data/OASIS_Real_Time_Weighted_Integrated_Actual_Load.csv) and [Day Head Market Load Forcast](data/OASIS_Day_Ahead_Market_ISO_Load_Forecast.csv) for Long Island. (Total 6pts)

- Draw the load curve (0.5pt) and load duration curve (0.5pt) of Long Island.  
- Show the characteristics of average day hourly load curve on Long Island  
  - All days average (0.5pt)  
  - Weekday vs. weekend (0.5pt)  
  - Monthly avearge (0.5pt)  
  - Seasonal average (0.5pt)  
- Find the hour(s)/day(s) with the largest forecast error, and try to explain why? (1pt)  
- Now make reasonable assumptions of EV penetration and EV charging on Long Island, and try to show how that would change the load curve. (1pt)
- Should PSEG Long Island worry about it, what policy/incentives should you use to change people's behavior of charging/discharging so to save costs for the utility companies? (1pt)


## 2. Energy justice

What is energy justice? Use one example to discuss how energy supply/demand may affect equity and justice of specific groups or populations. Write a short essay (~400 words) to explain your thoughts. (Total 4pts)

Play around the [En-ROADS](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=22.10.0&p1=110&p7=100&p10=5&p16=-0.03&p23=-30&p30=-0.07&p35=2&p39=250&p47=5&p50=5&p53=100&p55=100&p57=-10&p59=-100&p63=8.9&p65=100&p67=100) model, and change some of the parameters and check how assumptions affect modeling results.
