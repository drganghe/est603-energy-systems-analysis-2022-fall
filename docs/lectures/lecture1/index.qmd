Albert Einstein:

>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

## What is energy systems analysis

We also call it energy modeling, using computing models to simulate, design, and operate energy systems. Answering questions such as:

- What will be our energy demand?
- What technology to invest to satify that demand?
- What infrastructure do they require?
- Where/when should we build?
- What are the environmental/climate impacts?
- How much will it cost?

## Why models

- Prediction/Projection
- Simulation
- Optimization
- Control
- Stochastic/dynamic
- Policy: Scenarios

Models help us think


## Modeling is hard

## Why?

- **Risk**: System structural change could break our core data and assumptions that are based on historical experience. Example: shale gas revolution.

- **Uncertainty**: The exact timing and character of pivotal events and technology changes is unpredictable. Example: renewables cost changes, fussion.

## The Energy Trillemma: Balancing trade-offs
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/world-energy-trilemma-2021.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{.r-fit-text}
**Energy security**: Ensure reliable energy supply

**Energy equity**: Provide universal access to reliable, affordable, and abundant energy

**Environmental Sustainability**: Avoid environmental harm or climate impact

Those goals sometimes conflict with each other, and decisions has to make trade-offs between them

## Energy, economy, and environment
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/economy-environment-energy.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Economy**: Decent living? Growth? Degrowth?

**Environment**: Emissions, ecosystems constraints/goals

**Energy**: Work within constraints

## Modeling can be useful/insightful (an example)

- Build the structure
- Demonstrate the relation
- Visualize the changes
- Inform the impacts


## Renewables are achieving grid parity: a structural change

## End with two quotes {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Bill Hogan:

>It is not the individual results of a model that are so important; it is the improved user appreciation of the policy problem that is the greatest contribution of modeling.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Huntington, Weyant, Sweeney “Modeling for insights, not numbers":

>The primary goal of policy modeling should be the insights quantitative models can provide, not the precise-looking projections –i.e. numbers – they can produce for any given scenario.
