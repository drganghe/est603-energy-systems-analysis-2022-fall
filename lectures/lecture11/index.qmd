## Sample analytic questions

-   If energy efficiency is a good thing, why is not everybody doing it?\
-   How to design incentive programs to change people's behavior?\
-   How big is rebound, and what to do with rebound?\
-   What policies to push for sustainable energy consumption?\

## Energy efficiency

- Energy efficiency  
- Energy conservation (saving)  
- Energy efficiency and economic efficiency

## Standards{.smaller}

- Response to Information Failure  
  - Might be good policy if information is too costly/ineffective  
    - Eliminates cost of acquiring/understanding information
    - Eliminates consumer/producer choice
  - Focuses the market on producing high-quality products
    - Economies of scale 
    - Might be captured by technology (regular review of technology progress)

- Response to externalities  
  - Disallow products that would not often be sold if external costs were internalized
  - Inefficient if some consumers would purchase at the full social cost including externality
  - Difficult in some cases to write standards that still permit optimal innovation and adaptation

## Rebound{.smaller}

|     Category    |     Description    |     Example    |
|---|---|---|
|     Direct   rebound    |     Homeowners use more of the more   efficient service    |     Consumer drives more with a more fuel   efficient   car    |
|     Indirect   rebound    |     Homeowners re-spending on other   goods and services    |     Savings from efficient lighting   spend on 2nd   refrigerator    |
|     Economy-wide   rebound    |     More efficient production and   shifts in demand alter economic structure and growth    |     A more efficient steam engine   increases production changes structural relationships and leads to economic growth    |

## Economics of rebound{.smaller}

- Energy efficiency lowers the marginal cost of usage so increases usage  
  - Amount of increase depends on price elasticity    
  - Likely to be small effect if energy is small part of marginal cost of use  
- Energy efficiency may lower energy price, further increases rebound effect  
  - Likely to be small effect unless long-run supply is very inelastic  
- But energy efficiency also raises the up-front cost of products, reducing total sales

## Rebound might be overplayed

## Focus on welfare

- Is rebound a “failure”? Depends on the goal  
  - Reduce energy consumption?
  - Improve social welfare?  
- Rebound could be good  


## Sustainable energy consumption{.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/un-sus-consumption.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Absolute reductions in the material goods and energy we consume;  
- From material wealth and consumerism toward new measures of progress and well-being;  
- Technological innovation and efficiency gains that help us to refine production processes;  
- Recognition that consumption will need to increase for those individuals and communities whose needs are not being met, and  
- A transformation of our economy from continuous growth to within the limits of a finite planet.

## Summary

-   There are barriers for energy efficiency and inforamtion and standards can help address the energy efficiency gap\
-   Human behavior is complicated, and understanding it will help us to design policy\
-   Rebound is real but might be overplayed, rebound could be good if improve welfare\
-   Sustainable consumption and production within the limit
