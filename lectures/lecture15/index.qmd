## How modelers think about an energy system
 
- System components, structure, and relations  
- Networks (transmission, transport)  
- Objectives and constraints (if do optimization)  
- Validation and calibration  
- Intepretation and communication  


## Data quality

- Availability  
- Accessibility  
- Credibility  

Comparison, Validation, Verification


## Project economics

- Project economics is useful for basic cost-benefit analysis  
- Getting the price (discounting) right  
- Understanding technology dynamics will help to model future projections  
- Aware of the limitations   


## Energy sources and technologies {.smaller}

- Theory - learn and understand the physics of energy technologies: 
  - thermaldynamics (fossil)  
  - kinematics (wind)  
  - light and semiconductor (solar)  
  - gravity (hydro, tidal)  
  - atomic (nuclear)    
- Practice - learn all kinds of corrections based on real-world situation  
- The physics doesn't change, corrections help us to do better job in simulation and projections  


## Energy demand

- Energy demand is shaped by dynamic factors: populations, GDP, technology, regulation, and human behavior   
- Understanding those drivers will help us learn the magnitude and shape of our demand  
- Load forecast integrates all insights to the show  


## Energy, environment, and human health

-   Environmental and health impacts are the externalities of energy systems\
-   Energy-air-pollution-human health framework of analysis\
-   Energy-water-carbon nexus\
-   System impacts show the constraint in systems modeling

## Energy and climate change

-   IAM framework and models to analyze energy, emissions, and climate impacts\
-   Understanding the evolution of climate policy instruments\
-   Learn the applications and limitations of social cost of carbon\
-   Climate change affects energy supply and demand


## Power sector analysis

-   Power sector's central role in decarbonization\
-   Capacity expansion model to analyze the optimized investment decisions\
-   Decisions in the real world is much more complicated\
-   Emerging trends in the power sector


## Energy transition

-   Diverse factors that drive energy transition\
-   Common and differentiated solutions to energy\
-   Leverage the advantages\
-   Addressing uncertainties: geopolitics, wars, pandemic, and more


## Energy efficiency

-   There are barriers for energy efficiency and inforamtion and standards can help address the energy efficiency gap\
-   Human behavior is complicated, and understanding it will help us to design policy\
-   Rebound is real but might be overplayed, rebound could be good if improve welfare\
-   Sustainable consumption and production within the limit


## Energy poverty, access, and justice

-   Electricity/energy access is fundamental to other modern services: education, health, and information\
-   Energy access also has gender equity, health cobenefits, and other implications\
-   Energy justice is important to achieve just transition\
-   An reflection on our approaches to energy justice


## AI and big data for clean energy

-   AI and big data has transformed how we live, and how can we save the planet\
-   AI does not automatic add new insights, but it provides powerful tools to analyze increasingly available big data\
-   Learning those new tools and skills becomes necessary to work in the field\
-   The potential of using AI/big data to analyze our understanding of energy supply/demand and human behavior is enomorous.  

## Limitations of models

-   Know the limitations of models\
-   Use model appropriately\
-   Interpret/communicate the results effectively\
-   Modeling for social good  


## End with two quotes {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Bill Hogan:

>It is not the individual results of a model that are so important; it is the improved user appreciation of the policy problem that is the greatest contribution of modeling.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Huntington, Weyant, Sweeney “Modeling for insights, not numbers":

>The primary goal of policy modeling should be the insights quantitative models can provide, not the precise-looking projections –i.e. numbers – they can produce for any given scenario.
