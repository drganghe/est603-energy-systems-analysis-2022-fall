## Description

This class offers a systems approach and introduces useful modeling tools and skillsets to capture and reveal the grand challenges and opportunites of energy systems. The scope of this class includes energy systems overview, make sense of energy numbers, energy project economics, energy sources and technologies, energy demand, energy, environment, and human health, energy and climate change, power system analysis, energy transition, energy efficiency, behavior, and sustainable consumption, energy poverty, access, and justice, big data and AI for clean energy, limitations of models, and other emerging topics for the energy systems to achieve carbon neutrality. This class encourage students to design research projects, using the modeling tools, and presenting results. 

## Learning Objectives

- Develop comprehensive understanding of energy systems, i.e. the interaction of technological, social, economic, and regulatory forces that shaping energy production, conversion, and consumption; 
- Gain an understanding of main data sources and key methods used to analyze energy systems and their strengths and weaknesses; 
- Get introduced to major analytical concepts and modeling tools used in energy systems and policy analysis; 
- Develop basic analytical skills to translate energy systems analysis into effective policy discussion and debate.
